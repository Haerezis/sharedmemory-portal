I maintain and write in a blog named Shared Memory Blog.   

It comes in 2 versions :

 -  The first one is in French, where I talk about anything and everything,
    generally the subject is not serious, but it isn't always the case :
    [blog.sharedmemory.fr/](http://blog.sharedmemory.fr/)

 -  The second one is in English, where I talk about Computer Science, Programming,
    and all the things related to my works and my projects :
    [blog.sharedmemory.fr/en/](http://blog.sharedmemory.fr/en/)
