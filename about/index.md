Hi, my name is Thomas Kuntz. I'm a french student at the [University of
Strasbourg](http://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=accueil),
currently in the 2nd year of a Master degree in [Computer Science](http://mathinfo.unistra.fr/)
with a speciality in [Network and Embedded Systems](http://mathinfo.unistra.fr/offre-de-formation/master-mention-informatique/master-rise/).   

If I had to describe myself, I would say that I'm smart,resourceful and responsible :
I easely tend to take care of things myself, and only ask for help when I'm totally stuck.
I see this as a quality but also as a flaw, because it make me more used to work alone
than in a team (even though I'm still capable to do so).    
<br/><br/>
I'm also passionate about Computer Science, taking every change I can get to learn
new things, especially in embedded programming : even though my univertisy course
give some class on embedded programming, I have taught myself a lot about electronics
and embedded programming (for example with personnal Arduino based projects).   

On my free time, I usually work on my personnal project, play videogames (my favourite
games for now are FF9 and the Dark Souls series), read novel or mangas, and some
other minor things.

You can have a look at my resume if you're interested in me :
